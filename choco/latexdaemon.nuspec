    <!-- id is lowercase and if you want a good separator for words, use '-', not '.'. Dots are only acceptable as suffixes for certain types of packages, e.g. .install, .portable, .extension, .template -->

    <!-- Note that unstable versions like 0.0.1 can be considered a released version, but it's possible that one can release a 0.0.1-beta before you release a 0.0.1 version. If the version number is final, that is considered a released version and not a prerelease. -->

    <summary>LaTeXDaemon speeds-up compilation of LaTeX documents through background monitoring of source files and automatic preamble precompilation.</summary>
    <description>LaTeXDaemon simplifies and accelerate your LaTeX processing workflow. It runs silently in the background and automatically recompiles your document when a change is detected, so you can focus on editing your document using your favorite file editor while avoiding round trips with the command prompt. Additionally, it speeds up compilation by pre-compiling the preamble section of your LaTeX source that loads packages (`\usepackage{...}`).</description>
