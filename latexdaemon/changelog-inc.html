<p class="date"> 3 Mar 2007 - Version 0.904 </p>
<ul>
	<li>The .aux file is now backed up before compilation and restored if the compilation has aborted.<br />		
		Suppose for	instance that the user edits and saves the .tex file then the daemon will
		detect the modification and runs latex. If the user saves once more before the first compilation has finished 
		then, as in previous version, the daemon will abort the first compilation. However this operation corrupts
		the .aux file since latex writes this file during the compilation. With the new version of the daemon, such situation will
		be recovered by restoring the backup copy of the .aux file.

	</li>
	<li>The command line options -forcecompile and -forcefullcompile have merged into the command line option
	    -force={compile,fullcompile}</li>
	<li>Command line option -nowatch becomes -watch=no</li>
	<li>New command line option -afterjob={rest|dvips} to specify a job to start after a successful 
	compilation of the .tex file. There are just two possible values at the moment:
	<ul>
	<li>dvips : convert the dvi file to postscript,</li>
	<li>rest: do nothing.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>New commands available at the prompt: 
        <ul>
			<li>b[ibtex] to run bibtex on the .tex file</li>
			<li>c[compile] to compile the .tex file using the precompiled preamble</li>
			<li>d[vips] to convert the .dvi file to postscript</li>
			<li>e[dit] to edit the .tex file</li>
			<li>f[ullcompile] to compile the preamble and the .tex file</li>
			<li>h[elp] to show this message</li>
			<li>l[oad] file     to change the active .tex file</li>
			<li>o[pen]          to open the folder containing the .tex file</li>
			<li>p[s2pdf] to convert the .ps file to pdf</li>
			<li>q[uit] to quit the program</li>
			<li>u[sage] to show the help on command line parameters usage</li>
			<li>v[iew]          to view the output file (dvi or pdf depending on the ini file)</li>
		</ul>
        
        You can also set configuration variables with:
        <ul>
            <li>ini=inifile set the initial format file to inifile</li>
            <li>preamble={none,external} set the preamble mode</li>
            <li>afterjob={rest,dvips} set the job executed after compilation of the .tex file</li>
			<li>watch={yes,no} to activate/desactive file modification watching</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="date"> 2 Mar 2007 - Version 0.903 </p>
<ul>
	<li>
		new feature: a command prompt interface is available while the daemon is watching for file changes. At the moment
		there are just 2 commands: 'f' for launching a full compilation and 'c' for a normal compilation.
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="date"> 28 feb 2007 - Version 0.901 </p>
<ul>
        <li> When looking for the preamble file, it first searches for a file with the same base name as the tex file but with the .pre extension, if it does not exists it then looks for preamble.tex. This allows to have several main latex files in the same directory each of them having its own preamble file. 
        </li>
        <li>  change: option "-noextpreamble" now becomes "-preamble={none|external}:
        <ul>
                <li>Set to 'none', it specifies that the main .tex file does not use an external preamble file. The current version is not capable of extracting the preamble from the .tex file, therefore if this switch is used the precompilation feature will be automatically desactivated.</li>
                <li> Set to 'external' (default), it specifies that the preamble is stored in an external file. The daemon first look for a preamble file called mainfile.pre, if this does not exists it tries preamble.tex and eventually, if neither exists, falls back to the 'none' option.   If these files exist but do not correspond to the preamble of your latex document (i.e. not included with \input{mainfile.pre} at the beginning of your .tex file) then you must set the 'none' option to avoid the precompilation of a wrong  preamble. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
</ul>
<p class="date"> 26 feb 2007 - Version 0.9 </p>
<ul>
        <li>
                It is now easier to prepare the .tex files to work with the daemon: it suffices to add the command \input{preamble.tex} at the beginning
                of the main .tex file and to move all the code that needs to be precompiled to preamble.tex.
        </li>
        <li>new option "-noextpreamble":
                specifies that the main .tex file does not use an external preamble file. This
                option is set by default if the file preamble.tex does not exist in the same directory as the main file.
                You <b>must</b> set this option if preamble.tex exists but
                is not included with \input{preamble.tex} at the beginning of your .tex file.
                <i>Important note</i>: the current version is not capable of extracting the preamble from the .tex file, therefore
                if this switch is used, the precompilation feature will be automatically desactivated.
        </li>
</ul>
<p class="date"> 25 feb 2007 - Version 0.8 </p>
<ul>
        <li>new option "-nowatch" for launching the compilation just once (if necessary) and wihtout watching for file
                changes.</li>
        <li>new option "-forcecompile" to force an initial compilation of the .tex file even when no change is detected.</li>
        <li>new option "-forcefullcompile" to force an initial full compilation (preamble and .tex file).</li>
</ul>
<p class="date"> 24 feb 2007 - Version 0.7 </p>
<ul>
        <li>new option "-ini" to specify which initialization file to use when compiling the preamble. This
  can be use to compile a document with pdflatex instead of latex (using the parameter "-ini pdflatex").
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="date"> 9 December 2006 - Version 0.6 </p>
<ul>
        <li>bug fixed: when computing the MD5, the file is opened with reading sharing access to
ensure that the file content is not modified while computing the digest.</li>
        <li>bug fixed: no more crashe when runned without parameter.  </li>
</ul>

<p class="date"> 8 December 2006 - Version 0.5 </p>
<ul>
        <li>new: latex is executed in a separate thread. This permits to interrupt and restart the compilation if
        a source file is modified during compilation. </li>
        <li>new: the title of the console indicates if some errors occured during Latex compilation. </li>
</ul>

<p class="date"> 7 December 2006 - Version 0.4 </p>
<ul>
        <li>Change: compute the MD5 digest instead of the CRC. </li>
        <li>New: it is now possible to specify additional dependency files at the command line using globling (for instance *.tex)
                  The first file being the main tex file. </li>
        <li>New: console colors to distinguish Latex output from the daemon output. </li>
</ul>

<p class="date"> 29 September 2006 - Version 0.3</p>
<ul>
        <li>First version released.</li>
</ul>
