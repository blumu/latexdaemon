<p class="date"> 26 feb 2007 - Version 0.9 </p>
<ul>
	<li>
		It is now easier to prepare the .tex files to work with the daemon: it suffices to add the command \input{preamble.tex} at the beginning
		of the main .tex file and to move all the code that needs to be precompiled to preamble.tex.
	</li>
	<li>new option "-noextpreamble":
		specifies that the main .tex file does not use an external preamble file. This
		option is set by default if the file preamble.tex does not exist in the same directory as the main file.
		You <b>must</b> set this option if preamble.tex exists but
		is not included with \input{preamble.tex} at the beginning of your .tex file.
		<i>Important note</i>: the current version is not capable of extracting the preamble from the .tex file, therefore
		if this switch is used, the precompilation feature will be automatically desactivated.
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="date"> 25 feb 2007 - Version 0.8 </p>
<ul>
	<li>new option "-nowatch" for launching the compilation just once (if necessary) and wihtout watching for file
		changes.</li>
	<li>new option "-forcecompile" to force an initial compilation of the .tex file even when no change is detected.</li>
	<li>new option "-forcefullcompile" to force an initial full compilation (preamble and .tex file).</li>
</ul>
<p class="date"> 24 feb 2007 - Version 0.7 </p>
<ul>
	<li>new option "-ini" to specify which initialization file to use when compiling the preamble. This
  can be use to compile a document with pdflatex instead of latex (using the parameter "-ini pdflatex").
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="date"> 9 December 2006 - Version 0.6 </p>
<ul>
	<li>bug fixed: when computing the MD5, the file is opened with reading sharing access to
ensure that the file content is not modified while computing the digest.</li>
	<li>bug fixed: no more crashe when runned without parameter.  </li>
</ul>

<p class="date"> 8 December 2006 - Version 0.5 </p>
<ul>
        <li>new: latex is executed in a separate thread. This permits to interrupt and restart the compilation if
        a source file is modified during compilation. <br>
        <li>new: the title of the console indicates if some errors occured during Latex compilation. <br>
</ul>

<p class="date"> 7 December 2006 - Version 0.4 </p>
<ul>
        <li>Change: compute the MD5 digest instead of the CRC. </li>
        <li>New: it is now possible to specify additional dependency files at the command line using globling (for instance *.tex)
                  The first file being the main tex file. </li>
        <li>New: console colors to distinguish Latex output from the daemon output. </li>
</ul>

<p class="date"> 29 September 2006 - Version 0.3</p>
<ul>	
	<li>First version released.</li>
